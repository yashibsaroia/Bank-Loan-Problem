# Bank-Loan-Approval-Problem
This Repository contains a Python code to solve a loan detection problem using Deep Learning Algorithms


# Problem Statement

The dataset I have been provided with, is based on LendingClub company. The company is a US based lending company that provides lending services of various types of loans to its customers. When someone applies for a loan, the company has to make a decision: whether to approve the loan or not based on the applicant's profile and finiancial history. Two types of risks are associated with the bankâ€™s decision:

   1. If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
   2. If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company. </br>

Our Target Variable is loan_status, having four values

   1. Fully Paid (Applicant has fully paid the loan) </br>
   2. Charged Off (Applicant has not paid the instalments in due time for a long period of time, i.e. he/she has defaulted on the loan)</br>
   3. Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Fully Paid</br>
   4. Does not meet the credit policy. Status: Charged Off</br>
